This repository contains the source of a potential book, [Web APIs with R](https://jonthegeek.github.io/wapir/).
The book is being written in conjunction with the packages [{beekeeper}](https://jonthegeek.github.io/beekeeper/) and [{nectar}]([{beekeeper}](https://jonthegeek.github.io/beekeeper/).

I will eventually welcome suggestions, but right now I'm still working out the idea.
