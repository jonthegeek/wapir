This repository contains the source of an in-progress book, [Web APIs with R](https://wapir.io).
Please see the deployed book for the most up-to-date information about my writing process.
I am writing this book in conjunction with the packages [{beekeeper}](https://beekeeper.api2r.org), [{nectar}](https://nectar.api2r.org), [{rapid}](https://rapi.api2r.org), and anything else I realize would be helpful along the way.

I will eventually welcome suggestions, but right now I'm still working out the idea.
