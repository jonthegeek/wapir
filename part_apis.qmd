# What do APIs have to do with R? {#sec-apis-intro .unnumbered}

Reorg: Let's include rvest! We'll use it to introduce GET & formatting the stuff that comes back (specifically as HTML/XML in this case, but transition to httr2 from there). Maybe even use rvest to get a json payload at the end?

This is an intro to a part.

These are the chapters, introduced with a phrase that encapsulates them:

-   Describe the chapter.
    Reference it with a tag.

-   Describe another chapter.
    Reference it with a tag.

And then a sentence or paragraph about any leftovers.
