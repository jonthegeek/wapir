# What do APIs have to do with R? {#sec-apis-intro .unnumbered}

This is an intro to a part.

These are the chapters, introduced with a phrase the encapsulates them:

-   Describe the chapter.
    Reference it with a tag.

-   Describe another chapter.
    Reference it with a tag.

And then a sentence or paragraph about any leftovers.
