# How do computers communicate? {#sec-apis}

## Introduction

*(introduction will be written \~last)*

### Learning Objectives

After you read this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Explain what an API is.
-   Identify the pieces of an HTTP request. 
-   Describe how accessing a web page through a browser involves an HTTP request.
-   Compare and contrast HTTP-based API frameworks.
-   Recognize other web API protocols.

### Prerequisites

*(prerequisites will be filled in as I write, if I decide to keep this section)*

TODO: SOMEWHERE I should include info on using tools::CRAN_package_db() to find API-wrapping packages. Ideally pretty early to prevent people from wasting time.
