# Contributing to Web APIs with R

The intention is to publish this book in print, in addition to online.
Therefore, I need to own the copyright for everything included in the book.
I hope to make some money from the book, but it is unlikely to be a huge amount.
The online version of the book will continue to be freely available, and I'll acknowledge all contributions in the printed book.

To confirm that you're ok with assigned copyright to me for any contributions, please include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Jon Harmon" in any pull requests.

If you have any questions, please raise an issue, or contact me through email at jonthegeek\@gmail.com or on the [R4DS Online Learning Community Slack](https://r4ds.io/join).

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the book directly using the GitHub web interface.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, please file an issue, rather than trying to write a large section of the book yourself.
If you've found a code error, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the beekeeper project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
