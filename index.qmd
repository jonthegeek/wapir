This is the website for the work-in-progress book, ***Web APIs with R.*** 
This book will teach you how to work with the web from your R session.
This book will be published as part of [The R Series from CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/go/the-r-series/).

::: callout-warning
This book is very much a work in progress.

I'm using a ["backwards design" approach](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/backward-design-basics/), through which I'm creating [book club slides](https://r4ds.io/wapir) for an eventual [https://r4ds.io](R for Data Science Learning Community) book club.
I have completed the first draft of (most of) the slides!
Now I am presenting the slides to a group of friendly learners to figure out whether I'm covering the right material to the right depth.
I have already made a number of changes in response to the group's feedback!
Join us at the [R for Data Science Learning Community](https://r4ds.io) (find the #book_club-wapir channel) to participate!

I'm not ready for PRs yet (despite what you might see in some of the boilerplate).
However, if you have thoughts about what you'd like to see, please submit an issue!
