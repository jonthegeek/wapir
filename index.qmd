This is the website for the work-in-progress book, ***Web APIs with R.*** This book will teach you how to work with the web from your R session.

::: callout-warning
This book is very much a work in progress.

I am trying to dive in and do some actual writing, though!

I'm not ready for PRs yet (despite what you might see in some of the boilerplate).
However, if you have thoughts about what you'd like to see, please submit an issue!
