# How can I create my own APIs with R? {#sec-creating-intro .unnumbered}

TODO:

-   Consider adding a chapter on securing APIs (or at least include it in deploy.qmd).
-   Same for scaling. Scaling should almost definitely go inside deploy.qmd.

This is an intro to a part.

These are the chapters, introduced with a phrase the encapsulates them:

-   Describe the chapter. Reference it with a tag.

-   Describe another chapter. Reference it with a tag.

And then a sentence or paragraph about any leftovers.
