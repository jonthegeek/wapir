# Easily access APIs with httr2 {#sec-httr2}

## Introduction

*(introduction will be written \~last)*

### Learning Objectives

After you read this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Use API docs to explore available endpoints.
-   Fetch data from an API with {httr2}.
-   Build a {httr2} request piece-by-piece.

### Prerequisites

*(prerequisites will be filled in as I write, if I decide to keep this section)*

TODO: Somewhere in here, include something along the line of "Principles."

-   Make as few separate requests as possible.
-   Only request what you need (make requests as small as possible).
