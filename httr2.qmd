# How can I access APIs from R? {#sec-httr2}

## Introduction

*(introduction will be written \~last)*

### Learning Objectives

After you read this chapter, you will be able to:

-   Describe how {httr2} calls are structured.
-   Create and modify an {httr2} request.
-   Access an HTTP API with {httr2}.

### Prerequisites

*(prerequisites will be filled in as I write, if I decide to keep this section)*

TODO: Somewhere in here, include something along the line of "Principles."

-   Make as few separate requests as possible.
-   Only request what you need (make requests as small as possible).
