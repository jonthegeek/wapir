It looks like it’ll get a single table without any fuss. Is that true?\nBRIEFLY touch on data cleaning, but send them to R4DS for more details.\nMaybe note that a lot of {rvest} is reexports from {xml2}, which we’ll cover in detail later in the chapter.\n\nUsing SelectorGadget.\n\nStart by reproducing the table scrape.\nA second table where html_table doesn’t work as well (weird headers or something). Maybe; the next example might be enough.\nA web page with structured content that isn’t in a table. Like the Star Wars example in rvest, but someting else. Maybe information about HTTP request methods? Oh, or Xpath rules!\n\nUnderstanding what SelectorGadget generated/finding other paths (Xpath basics).\n\nStart by digging into what SelectorGadget produced for the examples above/what it means.\nAdd an example where it’s way more straightforward to do things sequentially (structured data in a particular cell of a particular table, something like that).\nCSS selectors vs Xpath. Hmm. Which is more straightforward? Probably teach Xpath because it lets you do all the things.\nNote the difference between \".//\" (search below the current node) and \"//\" (search anywhere in the document). You never want just \"//\" in a pipe, because it ignores previous steps! Probably put this in a call out.\nAlso note the flatten argument for xml2::xml_find_all()! By default it de-duplicates, so watch out if you’re trying to align lists. Make sure this behaves how I think it does, and, if so, provide an example where it matters.\nxml_attrs() (list all of the attributes) vs xml_attr() (get a specific attribute). Similar to attributes() vs attr().\n\nAdvanced {rvest} techniques.\n\nCan I ~easily deploy something that requires a session?\nIs the session stuff in {rvest} relatively stable?\nAre there options other than {rvest} that I should explore? {RSelenium}, {chromote} worth mentions, or too different?\nBridge into {httr2}. Don’t write this yet, bridges should be written last!"
