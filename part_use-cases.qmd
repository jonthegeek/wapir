# What are some ways I can use web APIs? {#sec-use-cases .unnumbered}

This part will give concrete examples of using different APIs or families of APIs.
This might just be an appendix pointing to examples throughout the chapters? 
I'm not sure yet.

These are the chapters, introduced with a phrase that encapsulates them:

-   Describe the chapter. Reference it with a tag.

-   Describe another chapter. Reference it with a tag.

And then a sentence or paragraph about any leftovers.
