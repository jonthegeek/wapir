# Introduction {#sec-intro}

<!--# This file is an intro to the *book.* index.qmd is an intro to the *website.* -->

Add a one-paragraph-or-so introduction here.
For now the general structure is strongly inspired by R4DS.
I'll likely make many changes as I fill this in.

## What you will learn

Describe the overall goals, and explain the learning objective hierarchy.

## How this book is organized

I'd love to know!

## What you won't learn

I like the idea of this section, but I don't know if it will fit.

## Prerequisites

Describe what we expect people to already know.
Probably include subsections.
Note that each part and/or chapter will describe the prerequisites for that part.

## Running R code

Explain what code looks like here vs to the user.

## Acknowledgements

This is the acknowledgement that appears in the actual book.
RStudio has code to auto-generate it, consider something similar.
